The rows with a white background denote basic Information Elements (BBIEs).

The rows with a green background denote associations between aggregations of Information Elements (ASBIEs).

The occurrence (cardinality) of these Information Elements is given as one of the following:

 - 1 – means the Information Element is mandatory and must have only one occurrence;

 - 1..n – means the Information Element is mandatory and may have more than one occurrence.

 - 0..1 – means the Information Element is optional and if used may have only one occurrence; or
