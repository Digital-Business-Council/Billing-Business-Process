# 2 Introduction 

The eInvoicing Implementation Guide specifies how to implement the Information Elements and associated business rules defined in the Council’s eInvoicing Semantic Model (Digital Business Council, 2016c) using an XML Data Format based on the UBL 2.1 international standard (OASIS UBL TC, 2013). This specification can be viewed as comprising of two sections: 

      • Specification of the Profile for eInvoice Document Data Formats (primarily Section 8); and 

      • Guidelines for how eInvoicing Documents are to be used within the Framework (primarily Section 10). 

This relationship is described in Figure 1.

While it is possible to implement the Profile for eInvoice Documents independently of the Framework, it is understood that most implementations will be within this context.
