### 7.1 Tax Invoices 

Tax Invoices are defined by law and need to be retained in order for a business to claim GST credits on purchases and demonstrate the amount of GST that has been collected by the business during the sale of Taxable supplies. 

Tax Invoices in Australia have various requirements set out in the GST Act and GST rulings made by the Australian Taxation Office (Australian Government, 1999) (Australian Government, 2013). These requirements can be found here:
