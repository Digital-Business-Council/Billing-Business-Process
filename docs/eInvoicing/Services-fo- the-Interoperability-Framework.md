# 10 Identifying Services for the Interoperability Framework (Normative) 

Within the Framework businesses register their capability to receive specific Documents as defined for specific business processes - known as Services. 

For eInvoicing there are three processes defined (Invoicing, Recipient Created Tax Invoicing and Adjustment Invoicing). These may be used in conjunction with the Response process. 

Within the Councilâ€™s Interoperability Framework a business may register its capability to receive Documents based on these Services (Digital Business Council, 2016b). The possible Values for these Identifiers are listed in Table 5.
